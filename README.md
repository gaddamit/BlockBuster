# Block Buster  ( from Grid Rush )

This is a class assignment in our Visual Scripting class using UE5's Blueprints.  
The requirement is to make a level that uses the FPS template that allows player to shoot objects in the scene.

## Mechanics
- Pickup the weapon and shoot
- The level starts with a group of cubes floating towards the player
- Target the yellow cube to clear the level
- Player will lose a life if the yellow cube reaches the end
- Achieve the highest level

## Notes
- The array of cubes rotate every 3rd level
- The target cube changes position every 5th level every second
